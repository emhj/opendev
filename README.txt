Info
===============================================================================
This repository is serving mainly as a collection of random code I will work on
from time-to-time.

It is split into directories based on the type of code.  In the case of mixed
code, I may chose to place the code underneath whichever language's directory
I originally began development.

Code directories are segmented into project directories.  Most code will be
developed in vim or Notepad++, depending on my mood.

Documentation will be iffy at best, mainly whenever I feel like explaining
something to my future self.
