This set of demos introduces you to QEMU and some basic usage scenarios.  It
takes you through the process of running a QEMU machine, connecting to it using
a VNC viewer, manipulating the serial ports to redirect Linux console
information, connecting to the QEMU machine using the QEMU monitor, creating a
basic root filesystem, the kernel parameters necessary to boot from that root
filesystem, and manipulating the init process to control how the machine
starts.

The final demo, demo 3, leaves you with a working, albeit limited, system from
which you can iterate to build a more robust working machine.
